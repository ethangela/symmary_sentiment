Q: Hey. hi. My question is for Nilanjan. Nilanjan, the margins for this quarter, is it based on your normal variable compensation provision or is that something which has taken a hit in this quarter?
A: Yeah. So, Kawal, we don't talk about the variable pay, of course. I think it's the next few -- there be enough news in the papers about that, but we don't give any commentary on variable pay.
Q: Yeah. I mean, I think it will make its way to the media after a month, so might as well talk about it now, Nilanjan.
A: We never confirm at any case.
Q: Okay. Got that. All the best in future endeavors, Nilanjan.
A: Thanks, Kawal.
