A: Thank you. Just first, everyone on the call, thanks very much for joining us and for your questions. I want to just summarize with a few points. First, we're very excited with the large deals at $3.2 billion, 70% net new. It really shows a foundation of what we see for the future. Very happy with the strong margin and also for an extremely strong margin improvement program that's in play. Our generative AI work is really pervasive. It's across all of our client discussions in our service lines and we believe we're building extremely deep capability within our Topaz set of capabilities. We see continued strong focus on cost takeout, consolidation and we have extreme strength in that. We feel good with that. We continue -- if that continues, we have a good play into that. And then finally, we feel good overall about the resilience of our business given the quarter and the seasonality that we had, and the overall economic environment. We feel really good about the resilience of our business and the future. So, thank you, everyone again and look forward to catching up at the next quarter call.
