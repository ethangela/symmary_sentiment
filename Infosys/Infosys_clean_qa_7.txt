Q: Hi, good evening. Nilanjan, in your prepared remarks, you expressed confidence in growth in the medium term. I was just hoping you could unpack that a little. When you say medium-term, is that just a comment about the fourth quarter or is that longer in duration?
A: Yeah, medium term is medium term. It's, definitely more than the fourth quarter.
Q: Okay. Thank you. And then also Nilanjan and Salil, I tried to reconcile when Salil observes the strength in the TCV and a record in nine months. But Nilanjan, you used the word subdued in your prepared remarks. It seems like you're saying it's hot and cold at the same time. So, I know these are where many of these questions are going, but how can the weather be both?
A: Hi, this is Salil. Maybe the way that we are thinking about this, we can share with you. The large deals really give us good confidence of revenue over the next several period in terms of the wins, both for net new and renewals. And the comment which was more around subdued, we look at it from a perspective of where we see less activity on digital programs and less activity on some of those type of projects where that takes away a little bit from the revenue. So, that's the sort of balance in our mind. One of them giving us that revenue outlook and the other where clients are under constraints on their own spend, reducing some of that. That's how we see the balance on that. Hopefully, that clarifies the comments.
Q: Thank you, Salil. I'll drop back in the queue.
