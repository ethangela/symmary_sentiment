Q - Dipesh Mehta {BIO 7406516 <GO>} Yeah. Two questions. First, on BFSI, if I look last almost three years, BFSI deal intake remain around $10.5 billion on last 12 months basis. So more or less flattish if I look, let's say three-year basis, in a way it gets reflected in revenue growth performance also in BFSI. So can you help us understand from medium- to long-term perspective how one should look at BFSI growth trajectory? Second question is about non-CIO spending exposure. If you can help us understand how we are placed to participate in non-CIO spending, CMO, CDOrelated spending? Thank you.
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} I think overall BFSI, I would say that it's a large portfolio that we have across banking, capital markets, and insurance and products and platforms. Because of the nature of this whole thing, now let's say banking does well sometimes capital markets kind of evens it out and then insurance has been doing well for us in the last several quarters. And the products and platforms also have a significantly good run for us. So I believe that when banking, capital markets, insurance and the platforms, if all of them fire, then you will see a very distinctively huge growth. But the nature is such that that looks one or the other actually goes for a flat or a negative growth. And we are managing it as a portfolio and we are happy that given that there is always a cost and optimization focus in BFSI while they continue to explore new technologies, and then in terms of the number of hours of technology services that we provide to banking, financial services, we track it to the extent that, look, we are gaining market share in BFSI, while the overall revenue and the portfolio is kind of -- sees a moderate growth. That's the way I'll put it.
Q - Dipesh Mehta {BIO 7406516 <GO>} Yeah. Can you answer the second one?
A - Samir Seksaria {BIO 21990312 <GO>} Non-CIO?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Non-CIO revenue.
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} Non-CIO revenue across the verticals I think you see some growth, especially if you look at the revenue on the CMO side or COO side, they are improving. And -- but then as they adopt cloud and Generative AI kind of technologies, I think what is really kicking off is the digital marketing right now and the whole TCS interactive portfolio that we have. We are seeing good growth and good opportunities that are coming there. We stay focused on, let's say, cost and optimization and vendor consolidation is one side, the growth and transformation projects on the other side. The majority of the growth and transformation projects, the large transformation deals that we have are really led by business.
Q - Dipesh Mehta {BIO 7406516 <GO>} Is it possible to quantify some number here? What would be the share of revenue coming from (Multiple Speakers)?
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} We're not (inaudible) to give that out and let's hope that this year, August well for it to give us more color on all of this.
Q - Dipesh Mehta {BIO 7406516 <GO>} Thanks.
