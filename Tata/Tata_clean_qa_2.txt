Q - Vibhor Singhal {BIO 16242119 <GO>} Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on our great margin performance. I got two questions. The first question for Samir. I think we brought a very solid margin performance in this quarter, and as you rightly said, after another solid performance that was in the last quarter. Is it safe to say that our aspirational band of 26% to 28% margin that we've long talked about is maybe no longer aspirational? And there are ways that in near- to medium-term future, there are possibilities that we can probably work towards that? Is there a possibility that we are looking -- I mean, are the levers that you see that are still underutilized that can help us reach that band? And I'll ask my second question later.
A - Samir Seksaria {BIO 21990312 <GO>} Sure, Vibhor. So, Vibhor, we remain committed to our guiding (inaudible), which is the 26% to 28%. And in doing so, we are focused on a disciplined execution and look forward to drive operational excellence. And the levers which we have been banking upon so far, whether it's in terms of productivity, utilization, realization, et cetera, or given the demand environment which we have seen banking on the subcontractor cost optimization do remain. So we have been able to leverage them and do provide further opportunities for optimization. And in the long-term, pricing also remains a lever which we can do. All of it in an environment where growth is sustained will only help accelerate our momentum.
Q - Vibhor Singhal {BIO 16242119 <GO>} Got it. Got it. Thanks a lot for answering that. My next question is to Krithi. I think the deal flow in this quarter was a bit on the softer side. We, of course, know this is a seasonally soft quarter, but on a Y-on-Y basis also, I think the growth was -- in the deal flow was a bit modest. So any specific thing to call out, or was it just that it was a soft quarter with higher furloughs? And the overall demand environment, in your opinion, or the client interest, have we seen a change in that in the last three months since we met in the last quarter results?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Vibhor, first of all, the TCV, we don't look at it as soft. It's in line because the TCV sometimes -- I mean, last quarter, if you take it, it had two large deals, a certain amount, two mega deals, and so it had the lumpiness. So we can -- we will not be able to measure TCV the same we do measure revenue. So there'll be some ups and downs. But overall, we look at the pipeline and we look at the deals that we close and geographical spread and the size of the deals and the type of deals, and we are quite comfortable with the deals that we are getting in. So we don't want to read it. We aren't seeing any softness on that front at all.
Q - Vibhor Singhal {BIO 16242119 <GO>} Got it. And no change in the overall demand environment that we are seeing, right? In terms of either for the positive or for the negative side, it's pretty much the same as we have been seeing.
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Yeah, that's the way I would also read it, Vibhor.
Q - Vibhor Singhal {BIO 16242119 <GO>} Got it. Got it. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks, guys, and wish you all the best.
