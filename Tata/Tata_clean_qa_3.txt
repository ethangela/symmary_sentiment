Q - Sandeep Shah {BIO 15336728 <GO>} Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the opportunity. Krithi, I think you might have answered the question indirectly, but any of your discussion with any of your clients in any of the verticals or markets gives you any indication of any emerging green shoots in terms of the demand because of the Fed meeting where now believes that the US economy could be a soft landing as a base scenario versus a recessionary outlook, which people were predicting earlier?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Yeah. So, Sandeep, you know that already some of our verticals are doing quite well. For instance, Manufacturing, we've been seeing growth, reporting growth, Energy, Resources and Utilities we've been reporting good growth. And even Life Sciences and Pharma, despite last quarter being weak has again returned to growth. And we've also been seeing our consumer business has been quite promising and we started seeing some green shoots in consumer business, but we'll be able to say for sure next quarter, but it looks quite promising.
Q - Sandeep Shah {BIO 15336728 <GO>} Okay. Okay. Helpful. And any initial color in terms of CY '24 budgets?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} No. See, two things, Sandeep. One is we have not heard any specific color. And two, also, given the overall uncertainty, we find our clients also very agile, even though they may have some thought in terms of what they want to spend, but we find that they keep also reacting to the market sentiment. So the whole budget or what project started or get passed, it will be very dynamic. So we don't want to read too much into that as well, Sandeep.
Q - Sandeep Shah {BIO 15336728 <GO>} Okay. And any update in terms of how the BSNL deal schedule continue to remain over four quarters to six quarters? (Technical Difficulty).
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Yeah. I'm requesting NGS to take that question for you, Sandeep.
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} I'm sorry, what is the question?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} BSNL deal workout.
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} Overall, I think the deal is (Multiple Speakers).
Q - Sandeep Shah {BIO 15336728 <GO>} The BSNL deal ramp-up may take six quarters. Any update on the same?
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} We have started to deliver the equipments and services for BSNL and as I explained in the previous quarters, we are approaching it from a zone and circles in which we have to roll it out. We have taken up the North Zone as the first thing and we have started to deliver equipments and services by rolling out the new radios that are slated to be delivered on BSNL in a few circles. The data centers in which the whole evolved packet code needs to be installed and operationalized, that's also been progressing well. So overall I would say that this is the first quarter where we have delivered close to about, I would say, 2,000 sites worth of equipments and they are under different stages of installation and commissioning. At the same time, the data centers installations are all progressing as per plan and it will get done over the next, let's say four quarters to six quarters as we originally envisaged.
Q - Sandeep Shah {BIO 15336728 <GO>} Okay. Thanks. And last question, just wanted to understand on margin levers, I think CFO has called out various margin levers. But is it fair to assume in each of these levers, there would be further headroom to improve further because subcontracting cost is even lower than where we actually were there during the pre-COVID times?
A - Samir Seksaria {BIO 21990312 <GO>} True, Sandeep. As I said, depending on how the demand environment continues, it could be one of the levers. There could be the other levers which we called out. Overall, as we have said, our long-term cost structures are aligned for us, for our aspirational band of 26% to 28%.
Q - Sandeep Shah {BIO 15336728 <GO>} Okay. Okay. Thanks, and all the best.
