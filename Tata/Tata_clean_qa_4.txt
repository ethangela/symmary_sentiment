Q - Kumar Rakesh {BIO 18105929 <GO>} Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. My first question was, Krithi, you in your prepared remark talked about the pent-up demand. So where are you seeing the signs of that and what do you think would be the trigger for that to materialize?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} No. I did also give out certain examples in that thing itself. Like for instance, you just take the consumer business is a channel modernization, store modernization. So we talked about number of areas where we find that investment has not kept up pace with the requirement, business demand. So that's what is giving us that confidence, Kumar.
Q - Kumar Rakesh {BIO 18105929 <GO>} And the catalyst for that to materialize that clients eventually (Multiple Speakers).
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} (inaudible).
A - Nehal Shah {BIO 15068369 <GO>} Catalyst.
Q - Kumar Rakesh {BIO 18105929 <GO>} The catalyst for that to materialize that clients eventually (Multiple Speakers).
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Catalyst would be, I would say that when they have the confidence about the stability of the overall macros Kumar. Once they are confident that the investments will -- the environment is good, the investments will come in.
Q - Kumar Rakesh {BIO 18105929 <GO>} Got it. My second question was you have talked about market share gain and also benefiting from vendor consolidation. So apart from your scale advantage, what is helping you to be the beneficiary of these trends?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Scale advantage is only one thing, Kumar. The most important advantage is the domain capability, contextual knowledge we bring in each of these. Like vendor consolidation, to be successful, you should bring in the value for the customers. And there has to be in terms of the contextual knowledge, that industry knowledge, in terms of delivery certainty. So all these things matter and also the process that you want to deploy. And when you do this, there should be a value for the customer. So what is your ability to bring in automation? So your transformational capability. Give you a roadmap of transformation. So you should be able to do everything. Just because we have a scale advantage, we don't win. We win because we have all the other advantages in giving a long-term sustained value for our customers.
Q - Kumar Rakesh {BIO 18105929 <GO>} Got it. Thanks a lot for those answers.
