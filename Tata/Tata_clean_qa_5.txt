Q - Manik Taneja {BIO 23174486 <GO>} Thank you for the opportunity, and congratulations once again for the strong performance on margins. Just wanted to prod you further with regards to the subcontracting expenses, which are now below pre-COVID levels. Is there something structural that we're doing to our delivery organization because of which these expenses have now reduced to a much lower level? Would appreciate some commentary on that front.
A - Samir Seksaria {BIO 21990312 <GO>} No. So, Manik, one is subcontractors we have been using to meet the short-term demand-supply mismatch. And it peaked because, one, there were border restrictions. And second, there was the entire supply side challenges which were happening in a higher demand environment. And we have explained that in terms of why those scenarios arose. Now, as the supply side challenges eased off, attrition cooled off, we are able -- and we invested into capacity, that is how we are able to manage it. And when we don't require those intermediate ones is when we are optimizing. And yes, it is below prepandemic levels as well, but -- and that has been thought through strategically, and you could see that reducing sequentially quarter-over-quarter for past few quarters.
Q - Manik Taneja {BIO 23174486 <GO>} Sure. Thank you, and all the best for the future.
