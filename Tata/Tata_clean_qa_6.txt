Q - Gaurav Rateria {BIO 16002637 <GO>} Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, first question is, with respect to -- is there any difference in the TCV growth trends versus ACV growth trends because of the deal tenors changing compared to what you saw last year, or it's largely been similar, no material change there?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Gaurav, what is the question like TCV trends (Technical Difficulty)?
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} TCV seeming lower because the tenors are shorter.
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} We don't see any trend, that kind of change, Gaurav. The TCV trend in terms of tenor continues to be consistent with what we saw before as well.
Q - Gaurav Rateria {BIO 16002637 <GO>} Got it. The second question is on the levers for margins that helped during the quarter. You did talk about realization and productivity. So the general perception is that in a tough environment, it's very difficult to use a lever of realization, but you have been able to do that. Is there anything going on with respect to client negotiations that has been helping you to benefit on margins? And is there -- like, this is over, or this is going to continue in coming quarters as well?
A - Samir Seksaria {BIO 21990312 <GO>} So, Gaurav, I will distinguish realization from pricing. Pricing environment is stable. Realization is an outcome, you can say it as revenue per FTE, and you could look at it that has been improving, and it's a combination of factors, utilization versus productivity, use of tool sets, et cetera, helping in. And we have been banking on these numbers for a few quarters. Structurally, on a longer-term basis, the cost structures would be based on these levers and pyramid, et cetera, and we'll continue to drive efficiency across these metrics.
Q - Gaurav Rateria {BIO 16002637 <GO>} Got it. And last question, I know that we should look at the TCV numbers more on a 12-month basis rather than on one-quarter basis because of the variations that can happen. But if you look at trailing 12-month growth, whatever that number is, should that be a fair reflection of growth going forward in terms of revenue, or there can be more nuances that you have to keep in mind? Thank you.
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Gaurav, by and large, the TCV is a lead indicator of more medium- to long-term growth performance and gives you the confidence on whether what the market is thinking, how our growth would be. So from that perspective, the last three quarters, it's been a very strong $10 billion almost every quarter. And even this quarter we had an $8 billion. And there have been some lumpiness in some quarters before, some through mega deals. And also, we don't see it as a great big variation from what we had in the previous quarter. And as we said before, this gives us confidence on the medium- to long-term growth potential.
Q - Gaurav Rateria {BIO 16002637 <GO>} Got it. Thank you very much.
