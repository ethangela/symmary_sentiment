Q - Apurva Prasad {BIO 17486075 <GO>} Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the BFSI vertical. Would it be fair to say that BFSI grew on a sequential basis if I adjust for the large program completion in North America, which you had referred to earlier, and the furlough impact in specific Europe BFSI account?
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} I think it's -- I would agree with your view. Adjusting to the large BFSI program that we completed in North America and the furlough impact had across markets, I think BFSI actually did well. The deal closures in BFSI vertical is also quite broad-based across markets. I would agree. I would agree that BFSI is actually a positive thing from my perspective, and it will only further from here.
Q - Apurva Prasad {BIO 17486075 <GO>} Got it. Thanks for that NGS. And Samir, my question to you on margins, what further headwinds do you see as BSNL ramps up next quarter or any other headwinds that you may want to call out for next quarter?
A - Samir Seksaria {BIO 21990312 <GO>} See, overall, we are focused on managing our margins at a portfolio level, and that's what we called out. There were a lot of apprehensions last quarter as well in terms of how large deal wins will impact margins. We look forward towards managing it at an overall portfolio basis. And you know the normal headwinds which we have in a year. Q1 would have expected increments related increases, et cetera. The business certainty or growth also works either way, growth definitely is a margin lever.
