Q - Ravi Menon {BIO 17870915 <GO>} Hi. Thank you, and congratulations on your margin performance. Samir, your popular belief is that large deals come with an increase in unbilled revenue. Can you talk us through why unbilled revenue is down Q-o-Q despite the BSNL deal ramping up this quarter?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Unbilled revenue (inaudible).
A - Samir Seksaria {BIO 21990312 <GO>} Okay. So, no, it's not always that large deals come with unbilled revenue. Yes, some of them would have it, but in this quarter, unbilled revenue is down because we had a focused effort concentrating on that metric. And I think overall the business has delivered quite well on ensuring unbilled revenues go down, and we see a slight impact of that in terms of the DSOs going up by two days because the unbilled revenues caught into invoicing. And that's a good thing to have because we have better visibility on collections.
Q - Ravi Menon {BIO 17870915 <GO>} Thank you. And if I heard NGS correctly, in the press conference, you suggested BFSI will return to growth next quarter. Is this due to a change in how discretionary spending decisions are being made or due to any specific deal wrap-ups?
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} I think, as I said, overall BFSI if I look at all our clients in BFSI, many of them actually grew or stayed flat, right? There has been a marginal growth in each one of them, and the actual degrowth eventually happened because of two large programs that we completed and furloughs. Adjusted for that, we believe that will be actually a positive momentum for us in BFSI vertical in the next quarter. Coupled with some of the deals that we have won, I think that should also ramp up in the coming quarter in the Q4 and Q1. All that is what makes us feel that BFSI will actually return to growth, at least in our portfolio of clients that we have.
Q - Ravi Menon {BIO 17870915 <GO>} Thank you. And one last follow-up for me. Could you talk about your specific advantages on contextual knowledge and how overall value that you provide to the customer and the solution? Could you tell us how many solution architects, overall, software architects you have within your employee base? Maybe a rough proportion?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} We don't give the breakdown.
A - N. Ganapathy Subramaniam {BIO 3282705 <GO>} We don't give that kind of breakdown, Ravi.
Q - Ravi Menon {BIO 17870915 <GO>} Thank you. Best of luck.
