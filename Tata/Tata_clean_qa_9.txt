Q - Moshe Katri {BIO 1504320 <GO>} Hey. Thank you and congrats on very strong execution in a pretty tough environment. I have two on my side. First, we continue to see a disparity in performance in Europe versus North America. Can you kind of provide some color on that? And do you think that disparity kind of will maybe disappear down the road given your pipeline?
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} So if you look at our pipeline in Europe has also been good. It's improved this quarter and we have seen our TCV in Europe also has improved. If you look at the parity in terms -- but also in fact, our Europe over on a sequential basis actually did better this quarter compared to North America. So on a log, it's reasonable to expect that Europe will also return to growth in the medium- to long-term. And we are, like we mentioned before, we are hoping there is a growth that returns in North America as well. I don't know whether there will be parity, but there will always be some differences. But we hope in the medium- to long-term both the markets will return to growth.
Q - Moshe Katri {BIO 1504320 <GO>} Understood. And then the follow-up. I just want to clarify, given some of your commentary and looking at your pipeline, are we seeing more optimism for discretionary spending during the next few quarters, more on the digital side and obviously, what we've seen on the TCV side, the main drivers were more on the cost takeout kind of area? But any color on the discretionary side outlook for the next few quarters? Thanks a lot.
A - K. Krithivasan {BIO 21549276 <GO>} Moshe, at this time, whatever the proportion between discretionary and nondiscretionary that existed in last quarter or last couple of quarters, we see that has not tilted or changed significantly. It's continuing to be the same.
Q - Moshe Katri {BIO 1504320 <GO>} Thank you.
