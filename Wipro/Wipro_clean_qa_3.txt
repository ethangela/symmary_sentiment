Q - Sudheer Guntupalli {BIO 23331060 <GO>} Yeah, thanks. Hi, Thierry, just one question. So growth in Q3 ended up towards the higher end of our guidance band, and you're calling out green shoots of recovery in consulting segment. Historically, March quarter has not been so bad for us in terms of seasonality. And after multiple quarters of revenue weakness, our base looks mathematically favorable. So in that backdrop, I'm little perplexed on how to reconcile the lower end of our guidance band at around 1.5% decline. So, are we being a little conservative here to keep buffer for any potential shocks, or is there any revenue impact due to the restructuring of the low-margin business that we spoke about?
A - Thierry Delaporte {BIO 3491345 <GO>} Sudheer, this is the nature of our guidance, to give a bracket so that they are -because the reality is that we are still in a market where there's things are happening and up and down and there's -- we need to see how this quarter turns. But I think this guidance is sharing a -- I would say, a cautious level of optimism.
Q - Sudheer Guntupalli {BIO 23331060 <GO>} Got it, Thierry. No, I was just surprised as to the lower end here implies the same kind of number that we did in December quarter, which is typically very weak seasonally. And this time around, almost everybody is seeing higher-than-expected furloughs. So I was just trying to understand how you arrived at that base case scenario. Is there anything specific that you're looking at or just it's a wide band that you wanted to be?
A - Thierry Delaporte {BIO 3491345 <GO>} Well, if I'm not wrong, Sudheer, actually the lower end of our guidance equal the top end of the guidance of the previous quarter. So it shows a trend.
Q - Sudheer Guntupalli {BIO 23331060 <GO>} Got it. Got it. Thank you so much. All the best.
A - Thierry Delaporte {BIO 3491345 <GO>} Thanks.
