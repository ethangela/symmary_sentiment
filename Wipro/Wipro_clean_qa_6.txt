Q - Anmol Garg {BIO 20825039 <GO>} Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. So I had a couple of questions. Firstly, just wanted to understand, when can we start to expect a net headcount addition. So now that we're expecting growth to come back maybe in medium term, can we expect that we add supply from the next quarter?
A - Thierry Delaporte {BIO 3491345 <GO>} So, Gov, you want to take that one?
A - Saurabh Govil {BIO 18697151 <GO>} Yeah. So look at the entire supply chain, today low attrition headspace for higher utilization. We have enough talent pool available. And for certain specific skills which we require, we'll continue to hire. So the current environment, we feel that its -- from supply will not be a constraint. As demand picks up for the quarters, we will definitely look at hiring in, in more bigger numbers.
Q - Anmol Garg {BIO 20825039 <GO>} And secondly, if you can indicate how has been the trends in deal wins in terms of the net new versus renewals?
A - Thierry Delaporte {BIO 3491345 <GO>} The net new versus renewal, so we are not communicating this information, but what I can say is that, if we look at the large deals, actually the majority is net new.
Q - Anmol Garg {BIO 20825039 <GO>} Sure. Sure. Thanks. That's it from my end.
