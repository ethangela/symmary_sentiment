Q: My question is for the margins for this quarter, is it based on your normal variable compensation provision or is that something which has taken a hit in this quarter?
A: we don't talk about the variable pay, of course. I think it's the next few -- there be enough news in the papers about that, but we don't give any commentary on variable pay.
Q: I think it will make its way to the media after a month, so might as well talk about it now, Nilanjan.
A: We never confirm at any case.
